One very neat looking parallelagram plot is shown in that video made with the primes manipulated in binary. \n\nAnother plot [from the third video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8c4uYnnNnc&ab_channel=Numberphile) in the series is even more suprising - an evil looking array of Imperial Star Destroyers. Lots and lots of them, and in formation! \n\n![alt text](https://github.com/mrcordiner/processing-sketches/raw/main/oeis/oeis-a117966.png)\n\nThis image is teased out of base 3 numbers. Many students will be familar with binary numbers, but likely not have done much with base 3, or ternary, numbers. The math might seem a bit strange at first but if you remember place value then base 3 numbers are just like decimal or binary numbers but with columns of different 'weights'.\n\n\nThis notebook will focus first on working with ternary numbers and some additional ideas. Then it will examine how the series is created in detail.\n\nBriefly the series is composed of the positive integers, which are written as a ternary number - which have the digits 0,1,2. These numbers are manipulated by changing any 2s into -1s. This fancy new result is then considered a number using \"Balanced Ternary\" where each column can only have the digtis 1,0,-1. This value is converted back to decimal and plotted.\n\nDetails and step-by-step breakdown and coding follows.\n\nhttps://oeis.org/A117966\n\nThis notebook runs in the browser using Basthon - see [these instructions](https://github.com/mrcordiner/processing-sketches/tree/main/oeis)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Python / p5 Version using Basthon Notebook\n### Converting to Base 3\n\nTernary are numbers use base 3.

There can be a 0, 1 or 2 in this column. The next column has a weight of 3, so counting up from 0 looks like 0, 1, 2, 10. The 1 is in the 3s column, which is 3 raised to the power of 1. The next column is 3 raised to the powr of 2 or the 9s column. The 1s column is simply 3 raised to the power of 0, which is 1 for any number.\n\nDecimal 5 is 12 in ternary because it is a 1 in the 3s column and a 2 in the 1s column or 1 x 3 + 2 x 1 = 5.\n\nA simple way to convert from decimal to ternary is to use Numpy."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy\nnumpy.base_repr(210, base=3)","execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","execution_count":2,"data":{"text/plain":"'21210'"},"metadata":{}}]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's build our own function to understand the process - start with going from ternary to decimal.
