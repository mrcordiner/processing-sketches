      <h2>Permuation City</h2>
      <p>
        A first test of using Python in the browser using pyp5.js. Python code is compiled to Javascript using Transcrypt and runs using the power of P5.js!
      </p>
      <p>Permuation City is a fascinating novel set in the near future where human consciousness can be "copied" into a computer. I haven't yet finished the book but I wanted to explore coding the book cover in Processing. Part of the story concerns itself with a kind of steganography where running code needs to hidden into an exsisiting area of active memory. I think that the designer was trying to show an aspect of this by "hidding" the title of the book into a grid of random text. </p>

      <p>In this Python/P5 sketch you can encode your own message into the book cover and change the rate at which it randomizes the cover. </p>
    
    <p>I am excited about the possibilities of being able to write Python/Processing code and have it run on the web. </p>
