# Permuation City Sketches

Sketches to create a reproduction of the grid based cover of Greg Egan's novel *Permuation City*. The first sketch was created using Processing's Python mode and the second using the pyp5js project.

Hosted copy of the pyp5js version can be seen on my blog http://mr.cordiner.com/2021/08/31/permutation-city/
