# Permuation City Sketches

Sketches to create a reproduction of the grid based cover of Greg Egan's novel *Permuation City*. The first sketch was created using Processing's Python mode and the second using the pyp5js project.

A live brower based version can be seen [here](http://mr.cordiner.com/2021/08/31/permutation-city)

Below is a Python generated cover running in web browser. This cover instead spells out "Python on the web!" - rather than the book's actual title.
